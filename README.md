# Protein Sequence Analysis Web Application 

This project is a bioinformatics web tool built as part of the *Introduction to Website and Database Design* course at the University of Edinburgh.  
It allows users to query protein families across taxonomic groups, perform conservation analysis (plotcon), motif scanning (patmatmotifs) and protein properties analysis (pepstats), and visualize results.
